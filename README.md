# Wave Programming Language

An experimental intepreted low-level programming language.

# Basic Syntax

Everything in wave is written around statements.

Statements are a named function with a set of input arguments and a set of output arguments.

For example, if we wanted to perform addition, you would write:

> wave.integer.add(a b)(c)
